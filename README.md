## projects summary

* ### crowd-funding  
    this project was focused on building a full-stack application using the smart contract as a "smart backend". the goal was to create a kickstarter-like webapp where clients could submit campaigns that other people could fund sending ethereums.

* ### erc20_token  
* ### erc20_token-faucet  
    this two projects were all about understanding how tokens work. the first one was about implementing a smart contract that would deploy and let people send and receive their erc20 tokens, while the other was about implementing a faucet in order to understand how different contracts interact with each other.

* ### smart-lottery  
    this project was about understanding a bit more some utility functions that developers can use and implement. given a rather easy project, the focus was all about how the blockchain works and what instrument or workarounds it gives me in order to achieve my goal.

* ### vending-machine  
    this project focused on understanding how truffle works. after implementing a simple vending machine contract for selling virtual donuts at 2 EtH each, truffle was used for running the test scripts and understand how the deploy script worked both on a test-net ( ganache ) and on the main-net.
